### The mission

xyz blablabla xyz

### Must-have features
- [ ] Create a graph of edges and vertices mapping to roads and intersections
- [ ] Apply an algorithm to find the *least dangerous path* between two streets and/or coordinates.
- [ ] Build a graphical interface that shows the *least dangerous path* on a map of New York.

  It does not have to be interactive, e.g. you can just get the street names/coordinates as arguments to a function, and show the result on a map.
- [ ] Code is PEP8 compliant
- [ ] Code is formatted using `Black`
- [ ] Code duplication is reduced.
- [ ] Functions and objects have been used.

### Nice-to-have features
- [ ] Create different algorithms e.g. one for the *most dangerous path*. Be creative.
- [ ] Make an interactive version of this where the user can add the streets/coordinates in the browser.
- [ ] Deploy your app on the platform of your choice.
